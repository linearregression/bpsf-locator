##bpsf-locator

BP-SF Locator is a programmatic analysis tool for Business Process Diagrams that
identifies opportunities for adding social components to existing
information systems. BP-SF locator implements the S-FIT technique
developed by Professor [Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/) of the University of Toronto and
her former PhD student, Lysanne Lessard, and was designed as part of
Allison Moore's Information Systems Design project while completing
her MI at UofT, with help from [Paul Reinheimer](https://github.com/preinheimer).

The core foundation of the BP-SF Locator consists of Business Process
Diagrams (BPDs) saved as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, which
are parsed and edited using PHP. BP-SF locator highlights the
occurrances of BPMN elements that map to S-FIT's social features
(profiles, networks, communities, user-generated content and
comments).
